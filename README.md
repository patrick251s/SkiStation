# Ski Station
This is a web application on the basis of which I prepared my engineering thesis. The application supports the management of the ski station. <br />
The following users can use the app:
1) Admins:
- determine the opening time of ski station
- define the price list of services
- manage the service staff and allocate the working time to them
- check activity individual users and, if neccessery, remove them from the system
- manage equipment rental resources
- monitor users and workers activities in the dashboards section
2) Users:
- buy tickets
- rent equipment
- take lessons with instructors
- track own activity in the dashboard panel
3) Workers:
- find out about the work plan 
- support the equipment rental process
- have a preview for the dashboards describing their work

What is more, all application users can send messages to each others, check the detailed weather forecast and change own account data.
